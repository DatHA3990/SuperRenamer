***Why I wrote this script***
This is a program made to rename multiple files more quickly.
This software was first made for my father, a cameraman at a small piano recital.
There, many students play their pieces and he would film them.
Then once home, he would rename each file, one by one, to the student’s name and the order in which the student played.
This was a long process and I wanted to make it shorter.

***How it works***
The working principle of this program is simple.
Put the files to be renamed in a folder, put all the names in the text box and then run the script and it would rename all the files.

***Instructions***
Run the program.
Put all files that you want in a directory
Type in all the name in the text box, separate each name by a new-line.
Choose the directory.
When you are ready, press RENAME.

***Features***
-	The script features a safety feature which means that the script won’t rename the files if the number of names and the number of files don’t match.
	This is meant to prevent errors like missing a file or a name.

-	This script is also secure. No connection to the internet so you are sure your files are safe from any theft or spy that want your files.

-	This program preserves the files format and doesn't mess with it.

-	This program is very simple to use.
